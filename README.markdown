TODO: add confit option for twitter names of people to DM or @reply when the build goes red.

[Integrity][] is your friendly automated Continuous Integration server.

Integrity Twitter Notifier
===========================

This lets Integrity send a tweet after each build is made.

Setup Instructions
==================

Step 1. Install this gem via `sudo gem install -s http://gems.github.com 
cwsaylor-integrity-twitter`

Step 2. Add the following lines to your Rackup (ie, `config.ru`) file:

    require "rubygems"
    require "notifier/twitter"
  
Step 3. Profit! Just kidding. Edit the project and update your twitter email
address and password.

Run the tests
==================

    rake spec
